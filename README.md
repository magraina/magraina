### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My life is all about facing problems, finding solutions and learn from them.
Therefore I have a passion for problem solving and developing software!

In the past I focused mainly on working with microcontrollers and PLC controls in the field of Operational Technology (OT) in building automation. And gained nearly 15 years of experience in the field of HVAC.
Through my work in technical support, I was faced with a wide range of technologies from in-depth experience with PLC controls in general, SCADA and visualization software and various communication protocols.
Experience with troubleshooting on complex problems regarding hardware and software, as well as finding solutions to problems.

However over the last few years I had the opportunity and began to focus heavily on web development, in a wide range from frontend to backend.
Where I quickly realized that I love to work in that field of technology. Which causes me to dig in deeper and I slowly tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and development.
