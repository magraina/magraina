### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My life actually is all about problem solving.
I love being confronted with problems, finding solutions and learning from them.
I am inquisitive and always open to learning and mastering new things.
That's also the reason why I'm passionate about software development.
Programming has always somehow accompanied my life, both privately and professionally.
